# Baymax-Virtual-Companion
A portion of a Baymax Virtual Companion app that has the ability to recognize emotions using OpenCV and DeepFace; a third-party facial recognition system.
There are two scripts. One for a still demonstration via a .jpeg or .png image.
The other is a live demonstration that can be run via a webcam. See "Dependencies.txt" to determine which modules and libraries are required.
All the files in the repository (.py, .jpg, .xml files) should be in the same directory (excluding "Dependencies.txt") in order to run.
